- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sharrison1023, a former teacher with a wide array of work experience
- 👀 I’m looking for an entry level position as a data analyst
- 🌱 I’ve been studying Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, SQL, and modeling techniques
- 💞️ I’ll be happy to collaborate on any projects, but if you're here, I'm assuming you're gauging whether or not to hire me
- 📫 Please email me at Sam.Harrison.Teacher@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/they
- ⚡ Fun fact: I still write lesson plans for fun and put them up on Tumblr.
* **Items in my Portfolio**
-    `Dynamic Chart of Character Traits by Gender` [View live spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/your-sheet-id/edit?usp=sharing)
-     Counts instances of traits from data entry, aggregates by gender using Flatten, Query and Countifs, then presents a stacked histogram.
-     This was designed for classroom use so the Gender column is hidden and unhidden with a javascript-containing button
